                I really like things that are fun to look at and listen to. I love music, but I like art and movies even more. I enjoy creating art drawings  because they tell stories with colors. I also like watching movies that make me think and feel happy or curious. Art and movies help me understand things differently and gives me a special way to look at things.Along with tho my another goal of mine is to create web pages that are both functional and useful.

            Review: This adaptation of Stephen King's classic is a really good piece horror media and also the classic coming of age storytelling. The performances by the young cast is also super good, making the fear and friendship feel more real instead of fake like it is in movies such as the conjuring. Pennywise is terrifying, and the practical effects are especially unsettling.

            Review: While Chapter Two didn't live up to the hype for me, it delivered a satisfying conclusion to the Losers Club, and the horror sequences in my opinion are really creative. It's a slightly different tone, more like surreal horror, but it's a good follow up that explores alot of trauma.
